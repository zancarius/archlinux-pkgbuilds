# Arch Linux PKGBUILD Collection

The PKGBUILDs contained in this repository are mostly odds and ends I find
useful for my own purposes. If you find them useful, too, feel free to
clone or fork this repository. Likewise, if you feel an update is lacking,
please don't hesitate to send a pull request or file a ticket.

It's helpful to keep in mind that this repository mirrors the PKGBUILDs I
presently maintain in the AUR along with a few others I have written or
adopted that have no business being anywhere else. I would appreciate it if
the PKGBUILDs you find here that have no analog in the AUR remain that
way--there are some that undoubtedly defy or violate the AUR PKGBUILD
guidelines (but that's not to say you may not wish to use them!).

In order to avoid confusing visitors to this repository, I've moved retired
packages into a separate branch. I won't delete them (until I have good
reason to do so) on the off chance I have reason to revisit or rebuild
them, but they will no longer persist on `master`.

## A Note about Repository Sources

Competition is a good thing for consumers. In order to ensure this repository
remains available, I have started a migration to Bitbucket and GitLab as I feel
they are reasonable alternatives that work well for my use case. The GitHub
repository will eventually be relegated to a mirror, but I will continue
accepting issues and pull requests on GitHub more or less indefinitely. If
there is a service you prefer among the three, don't hesitate to use that in
lieu of the others.

As of present, the mirrors available for my PKGBUILD repository are:

### GitLab (Primary)
[https://gitlab.com/zancarius/archlinux-pkgbuilds](https://gitlab.com/zancarius/archlinux-pkgbuilds)

### Bitbucket
[https://bitbucket.org/zancarius/archlinux-pkgbuilds](https://bitbucket.org/zancarius/archlinux-pkgbuilds)

### GitHub
[https://github.com/zancarius/archlinux-pkgbuilds](https://github.com/zancarius/archlinux-pkgbuilds)

Use whichever is most convenient for you.
